# Data Cleaning

This project rolls data cleaning in Pandas together with vizualizing said data in graphs using Seaborn and NumPy

The Sales_Data_Cleaning (1) notebook contains the project itself as well as my comments throughout talking through my thought process as I encountered issues and thought through acheiving a clean dataset with which to analyze sales data.

Additionally are the the final graph images as well as the xlsx files that the project is based on.
